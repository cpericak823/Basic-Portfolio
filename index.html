				<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! Throughout this site, you will be able to learn more about me, my work, and how to contact me. 
				</p>

				<p>
				I currently work at Northwestern University in on their Annual Giving Team. Within this role, I determine the strategy of NU's phone calling program and manage this data. In addition, I also assist with our digital fundraising, more specifically our email campaigns. These campaigns are heavily segmented in order to target the most undergraduate alumni who are most likely to give to the University.
